function blist = bridges(g,algo)
% bridges(g,also) --- find all cut edges in g
% algo specifies the algorithm. Current choices are these:
%
% 'path'    Deletes each edge from the graph and checks if there is a path
%           between its endpoints. A few tricks are employed so we don't
%           have to check every edge.
%
% 'matrix'  Uses a basis for the null space of the signed incidenced
%           matrix. 
%
% Main idea for the path code due to Mel Janowitz
