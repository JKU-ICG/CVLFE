# a standard hyperedge is created like this:
first  one two three

# a hyperedge can be specified on two (or more) lines like this:
 second   one  four
second five

# on the next line "one" is a hyperedge and "one" is a vertex but they are
# considered different objects
one one


# the hypergraph specified by this file has three hyperedges:
# {one, two, three}   named first
# {one, four, five}   named second
# {one}               named one, but a different "one" from vertex "one"
#
# the output will be this:
# 1       1   
# 1       2
# 1       3
# 2       1
# 2       4
# 2       5
# 3       1
