hypergraph_parser is a program to read text files that represent hypergraphs and
convert them into a form that MATLAB can easily read. It reads from the standard
input and writes to the standard output:

./hypergraph_parser < text_input_file > two_col_numeric_file


Each line of the input file should be of the following form:

edge_name vertex1 vertex2 .... vertexN

where each token may is delimited by white space. (Exception, a line that begins
with the # character is ignored.)

Only the first word on each line is an edge name; all the other name the
vertices contained in that edge. 

WARNING: An edge and a vertex might have the same name, but that does not mean
they are the same thing --- the names of edges have no bearing on the names of
vertices. 

hypergraph_parser converts each edge name into consecutive numbers (1, 2, 3,
...) and likewise for vertex names in the order in which they are encountered. 

WARNING CONTINUED: If there is a vertex and an edge with the same name, there is
no reason to think they will be given the same number.

See the file "test" for an example of an input file.

The output file is designed for reading into MATLAB with the "load" command.
Each line of this file has two numbers separated by a tab. The first number is
the number assigned to an edge and the second number is the number assigned to a
vertex in that edge. Try ./hypergraph_parser < test to see what the output looks
like. 

hypergraph_parser can also be used for parsing bipartite graph data. In this
case, each line of the input file should be thought of in this form:

X-vertex-name Y-vertex-name-1 Y-vertex-name-2 ... Y-vertex-name-N
