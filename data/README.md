## DATA

Example data needs to be provided in the `data` folder in form of Matlab data files (.mat). 
Data is provided for several scattering levels for 30 20µm-sized microbeads (in the code they are called neurons).
Since the data files are large (>200MB) they are stored outside of the repository.
Please use the download provided above.
The simulation data is generated by the [phase-space measurement technique](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-23-11-14461) from Liu for which we don't own the copyright. Therefore, the source code for data generation is omitted in this public repository.
