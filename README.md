# CVLFE
**Compressive Volumetric Light-Field Excitation**

## SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE
#### System Requirements:
A decent PC with enough RAM (16 GB or more, depending on the dataset).

#### Software Requirements:
- Matlab (>R2015b) with Image Processing Toolbox.
The software was tested on Windows 10 running Matlab R2015b. 

#### External Libraries/Tools (included in `thirdparty` folder):
- some functions from Ron Rubinstein's [OMP-Box](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/software.html)
- SART implementation by Alexander Koppelhuber
- [NMF toolbox](https://sites.google.com/site/nmftool/) by Yifeng Li and Alioune Ngom 
- [matlab-tree](http://tinevez.github.io/matlab-tree/) by Jean-Yves Tinevez to represent tree data structures in Matlab 
- [matgraph](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19218-matgraph) library by Edward Scheinerman to schedule parallel recordings 

#### Instructions:
- Download or Clone the Software from Github
- The package should run as it is without any modifications. Just run `run_all.m` and it will create results with a low scattering level. 
- Results will be stored in a `results` folder.
- The scattering level can be changed to the scattering levels provided in the `data` folder.

## DATA
Example data is provided in the `data` folder in form of Matlab data files (.mat). Data is provided for several scattering levels for 30 20µm-sized microbeads (in the code they are called neurons).
The simulation data is generated by the [phase-space measurement technique](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-23-11-14461) from Liu for which we don't own the copyright. Therefore the data generation is omitted in this public repository.
